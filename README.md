# 🤬 The Ugly Gauntlet Discord Bot

The **Ugly Gauntlet** is a brutal, hilarious, lore-infused battle royale game built for Discord — created originally for the [Charm of the Ugly](https://charmoftheugly.com/) NFT project and now accessible for **everyone**, completely **FREE**.

## 🧠 What Is It?

Every game of the Gauntlet is chaos:
- Players join via button
- Each round, someone is randomly **eliminated** with unique lore and effects
- Includes **revival events**, **boss rounds**, **curses**, **boons**, **survival traps**, **NFT embeds**, and **token rewards**
- Audience can vote, curse players, and influence the game live
- Entirely automated and designed for **multiple servers**, with full admin control

## 🛠 Features
- Multi-server support with server-specific settings
- Easy-to-use `!gauntlet` and `!startg` commands
- Special `!gauntlettrial` mode for testing
- Stunning randomness: eliminations, resurrections, bosses, audience votes
- NFT image embeds using IPFS
- $CHARM (or any token) DRIP reward payouts via API
- Interactive buttons for join, survival, gamble, vote, and revive
- Lore-rich, chaos-filled, endlessly re-playable

## 🔧 Admin Setup (Per Server)

Type `!GauntletAdmin` in your server to open the configuration panel:

* Set **Host Roles** (who can start games)
* Set **Game Admins** (who can manage config)
* Set your **NFT image base URL**
* Set your **DRIP token API + Auth key**

These are stored per-server, so every project can customize their Gauntlet instance!
